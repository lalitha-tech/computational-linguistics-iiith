Peer to peer Evaluation Feed back
This peer to peer Evaluation task is really interesting.This concept of peer to peer evaluation creates a sense of responsibility towards our peers and also shows our honesty and sincerity towards our work unlike being careless in evaluation.
On technical front We get to evaluate the mistake done by our peers and examine where they have went wrong(at what point of code) leading them to a wrong output which enhances our debugging skills.
